Tetris Marathon is a one-player game. A 10 x 22 grid will appear on the screen. A 4-block variation, called a
tetromino, is generated at the top of the grid and drops one grid square per second( initial speed ) towards the 
bottom of the grid. The user will interact with the game by controlling the placement and position of the 
tetromino through the interaction with the keyboard( e.g; arrow keys ). To gain points, the user must occupy 
an entire row with blocks of any assortment of tetrominoes. This will clear the line, shift every block on top 
downwards, and increment points value by one. Difficulty is based off of drop speed of the tetromino and changes 
when a milestone points is reached( for every five lines cleared, increase speed by 75 milliseconds ).The game ends
when the user stacks to the top of the screen. This game cannot be won, only prolonged. Input will be received by 
the user’s interactions with the tetromino (arrow keys & other keys) and string manipulation of high scores. 
A random generator will be used to identify which type of tetromino will be displayed next. High scores including
username, will be inputted to a file for reference. High scores will also be displayed.
